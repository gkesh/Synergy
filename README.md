# Synergy
This is a basic website that I created during my eary days of college in order to get a big of a hang of Web Design/Programming.
It is a music store website bt doesnt have any support for dynamic content except for the login/logout system. It will show the user information though.
If you wish to use the login logout system just add a database called Synergy in your xampp mysql database.
Well if you wanna take a look, go for it, godspeed.
